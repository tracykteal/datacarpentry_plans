Data Carpentry future

With the success of the first Data Carpentry and the enthusiasm for the course in 
general we're thinking about what's next for Data Carpentry.

Each instructor has been contacted individually by email from many people, 
there has been great interest over Twitter and in response to blog posts. 
This interest has come from people 
in biology, genomics, digital humanities, social sciences and libraries in particular.
This interest has reflected a desire to take the course, teach the course or host
workshops. 

The challenge is therefore to meet these needs across many different locations and 
domains of interest.

What would success for Data Carpentry look like

Help to train the next generation of researchers in good data analysis and management practices
to enable individual research progress and open and reproducible research.

Data Carpentry's aim is to teach these skills.
If a researcher wants to take a Data Carpentry course, our hope it that we will be 
able to provide that resource.

This means that Data Carpentry hopes to have:

- The ability to host workshops in many different locations, even to run
them multiple times in the same location. 
- Materials developed for domains of interest 
- Materials in Python and R
- A streamlined assessment where we can assess learning in a workshop and its effects
as researchers progress through their careers
- A forum for continued engagement on Data Carpentry post workshop
- A set of resources where learners could look for more information on particular topics
(SWC already has good online tutorials for many of these topics)
- More advanced workshops - data visualization, more advanced R or Python for statistics


Details:
- A checklist for how to run a workshop 
- An automated system for reminding workshop organizers when emails need to go out
or other tasks need to be done
- A registration system for workshops, with registration information going back to 
organizers in an automated way



How these needs can be met:

Already in place:
- github for the development and distribution of materials
- online SWC tutorials on many topics
- first set of materials developed by SWC and adapted for NESCent workshop

To be established:
- Personnel for establishing workshop guidelines and workflow
- Personnel for materials development and coordinating efforts
- Train the trainer workshops to train many instructors so that they can host local
workshops
- Instructors for train the trainer workshops
- Personnel for organizing workshops 



One idea is to run Data Carpentry almost like a franchise, with a strong train the 
trainers component that would allow instructors to run many workshops locally, 
reducing coordination efforts and travel costs for instructors. Many people feel 
qualified to teach the materials covered in Data Carpentry with some training on 
how the workshop should be taught. This differs somewhat from Software Carpentry, where
the topics are perceived to be a bit more technical and local personell have less 
confidence in their ability to teach the materials.
