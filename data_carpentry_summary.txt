Data Carpentry

The idea for Data Carpentry came out of an NSF BIO Centers COLLABIT working group with 
representatives from SESYNC, NESCent, iDigBio, BEACON, NEON and iPlant. There was a shared 
need across the BIO Centers for increased researcher knowledge in data management and 
analysis and computational literacy. 

We met in a breakout section to talk about developing a 'data and computational literacy'
workshop. Many of the attendees had taken or taught Software 
Carpentry workshops and knew it was a good model for developing material and training.

Attending:
People: Tracy Teal (lead) (BEACON), Shannon Oliver (iPlant), Mary Shelley (SESYNC), 
Nicole Hopkins (iPlant), Hilmar Lapp (NESCent), 
David Bryson (BEACON), Deborah Paul (iDigBio), Melissa Cragin (NSF observer)

In this breakout, we set an overall objective and topics to cover

Objectives for learning:
We would like people to be able to retrieve, view, manipulate, analyze and store their's 
and other's data in an open and reproducible way

In following COLLABIT calls and over email, we spent a lot of time working to decide 
what topics and materials to teach and how to focus the workshop.

We ran the first Data Carpentry at NESCent on May 8-9 with Karen Cranston, Tracy Teal,
Ethan White and Hilmar Lapp as instructors.  Darren Boss (iPlant), Matt Collins (iDigBio), 
Deb Paul (iDigBio), Mike Smorul (SESYNC) were assistant, with Deb Paul teaching an 
short tutorial on OpenRefine as well.

The workshop went well, with some important lessons learned, outlined in the blog post.
We were also excited about the enthusiasm for the course in general.
